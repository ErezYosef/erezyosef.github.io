PhD student in Electrical Engineering at <a href='https://english.tau.ac.il/'>Tel-Aviv University</a>, supervised by Prof. <a href='https://www.giryes.sites.tau.ac.il/'>Raja Giryes</a>.

I develop AI and computer vision algorithms that integrate camera design with advanced imaging processes, pushing the boundaries of computational photography.

Check out my [publications](/publications/) and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NOIkjY8AAAAJ&hl'>Google Scholar</a> for detailed insights into my research.

<!-- 
and the [conferences](/erezyosef/publications/) I attended.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
